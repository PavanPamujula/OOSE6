An Experimental Study with Imbalanced Classification Approaches for Credit Card Fraud Detection


/*INTRODUCTION*/
Now a day the usage of credit cards has dramatically increased. As credit card becomes the most popular mode of
payment for both online as well as regular purchase, cases of fraud associated with it are also rising. 
In this paper, we model the sequence of operations in credit card transaction processing using a Decision tree and Deep Neural Network show how it can be used for the detection of frauds. An both algorithms is initially trained with the normal behaviour of a cardholder.
If an incoming credit card transaction is not accepted by the trained with sufficiently high probability, it is considered to be fraudulent. At the same time, we try to ensure that genuine transactions. We present detailed experimental results to show the effectiveness of our approach and compare it with other techniques available in the literature.

Issues
Credit card fraud is a criminal offense. 
It causes severe damage to ﬁnancial institutions and individuals. 
Therefore, the detection and prevention fraudulent activities are critically important to ﬁnancial institutions. 
Fraud detection and prevention are costly,time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks.Anumber of signiﬁcant research works  have been  dedicated to developing innovative solutions to detect different types of fraud. However, these solutions have been proved ineffective. According to Cifa, 33,305 cases of credit card identity fraud were reported between January and June in 2018.
